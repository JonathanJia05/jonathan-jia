### **Robot-sumo**  
A framework using OpenAI Gymnasium and Pygame with TensorFlow, designed to test and develop robot control strategies for Japanese Robot Sumo matches. Meant to leverage reinforcement learning, enabling the robot to dynamically adapt its strategies in response to opponent movements, rather than relying on hardcoded behaviors.

#### **Aug 2017 - May 2023**  
### **Arsenal Robotics**  
Founded Arsenal Robotics, a VEX Robotics Competition team ran out of my family's basement. Led team to be 5x World Championship competitors and 7x World Championship qualified. Outperformed multiple well-funded organizations despite operating with 10-30x less funding. Built a strong national presence through social media, generating over 16,000 views and establishing the team as a prominent name at national signature events.

- Notable accolades:
  - 2023 New York State Champions
  - #1 ranked team in New York State
  - 26 total awards

###Future project ideas:
- **Photography blog. Shares the pictures I take when travelling + going to car events.** Allows me to further my web dev skills + share my hobbies.
- **AI poker engine. Recognizes cards on table and the bets to output the most optimal move using GTO poker strategy.** Allows me to step into the AI realm more + create a potentially a game disrupting product.
- **AI calorie tracker. Using object recognition with a digital scale reading, it will accurately calculate total calories to make weight loss/gain a less painful endeavor.** Allows me to work with AI more + create a product that I feel will be extremely useful and marketable towards the gym community.
